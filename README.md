## Planning Story

  First the user will be presented with the choice to either sign up, sign in, or shop.  An unregistered user may view products, but must sign in to purchase a product.  Once the product is purchased, a success message will be displayed and the user will have the option to modify their order's delivery date or cancel their order. The user will be able to view all past purchases.
